1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION	
Trade is an economic concept which involves buying and selling of the commodities, or exchanging goods and services between needy people. Trade is vital in an exceedingly way that it increases competition and reduces overall world wise cost of a product. India is simply second largest market place (after China) as regards the human resource. Hence many foreign countries exploit this fact, especially china, to sell their products. Hence our import trade matters lots from economic point of view. On the opposite hand, we being second largest population, also produce an enormous range of products, all due to diversity existing in India, while in north India, there’s one huge production of virtually all every type of grains and also fruits; in south India, there exists a production of all kinds of spices; in East India, there’s one large amount of tea-production. All of often this is just a piece of what is exported to all other regions. So, to balance the economy with feasible trade quantity, it’s one need to research which area of production needs more attention for exports and which product needs to be encouraged for production to decrease the import. So, the Data Analysis part points at this area of the mini project. Import and Export both are very dynamic in nature since each year it evolves in what needs as an import and what needs to produce in order to export. This project includes dashboard for Data Analysis and Visualization of the trade data.
•	HARMONIZED SYSTEM
The Harmonized System is a world nomenclature for the classification of products. It allows countries to classify traded goods for customs purposes on a typical basis. On the worldwide level, a six-digit code system may be a Harmonized System (HS) for classification of goods.

•	ASEAN COUNTRIES
The ASEAN is consists of Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar and Brunei. India’s target on a strengthened and multi-faceted relationship with ASEAN is an outcome of the numerous changes within the world’s political and economic scenario since the first 1990s. Trade and investment relations between India and ASEAN are steadily growing, with India as fourth largest ASEAN. India's 

Trade with ASEAN stands at US$ 81.33 billion, which is approximately 10.6% of India's overall trade. India is 11.28 percent of our total export figures for exports to ASEAN.

1.2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT  
Import and export of products are very dynamic in nature since per annum it evolves in what has to be needed as an import and what must be produced so as to export. An analysis report is required which helps in analyzing the trade business.
1.3.	PURPOSE
To analyze which area of production needs more attention for exports and reduce imports with relevancy ASEAN countries.
1.4.	SCOPE
 The project intend towards generating analysis on Indian trade.

6.	 DETAILED DESIGN

6.1.	METHODOLOGY

	RESEARCH DESIGN: The project is descriptive in nature as it provides the description of the current state of the country’s foreign trade in the period of 2014 and 2020.

	COLLECTION OF DATA: The project is based exclusively on static secondary data collected at trade import/export site of the government, the reports and related sources.

	STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES: Various statistical tools and techniques like, average, standard deviation and graphical representation to analyse the data gathered will be used.


6.2.	HYPOTHESIS TESTING 

NULL HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (Ho): The exports and the imports gradually increases between the India and ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) countries.

The null hypothesis cannot be rejected in this project and the alternative hypothesis can therefore be rejected. The alternative to this hypothesis is therefore as shown below: 

ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT (H1): Between India and ASEAN countries exports and imports are gradually decreasing.

	
 
            
	 T-TEST 

 
Fig. 6.1 T-test for Exports
Sample mean is found to be 26.61 and population mean of the growth of the exports region wise is between 17.78 and 35.43.
T-TEST RESULT STATEMENT: At 90% confidence there is no enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 

 
Fig. 6.2 T-test for Imports

Sample mean is found to be 37.74 and population mean of the growth of the exports region wise is between 24.06 and 51.43.
T-TEST RESULT STATEMENT: At 90% confidence there is no enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Country Wise for Expensive Items Malaysia has the most share followed by Indonesia and Singapore.



















8.	 SOFTWARE TESTING

8.1.	MANUAL TEST CASES
Nowadays, software research is necessary to identify the mistakes, errors and defects made during the software testing stages. The software industries have always prioritized the delivery of the optimum quality software product. However, developers cannot guarantee these aspects without assessment of software components in anticipated and unexpected conditions. Therefore, all large and small software components are tested. Therefore, the testing was done manually, where several test cases have been created, and the software has also been tested. Not if the expected outcomes have been achieved is marked as Pass or Fail.
 
Fig: 8.1 Manual Testing

	The application is tested under eleven different test cases. The step details has been listed along with the results that are expected from those corresponding cases. After the testing is performed, the Actual Results obtained under those specific cases are listed. Further, results are analysed to check whether the Actual Results are matching with the Expected Results.
	In the above figure, the project under the testing phase, behaves in a similar manner which is expected, and therefore, the Pass is marked for all test cases. Therefore, the project passed all the test cases successfully.



 

9.	 CONCLUSION

The trade dataset is scraped from the Department of Commerce, Govt. of India website. The data used for Analysis is monthly. Monthly data is available from January, 2014 to December, 2020. The total trade amount (Import/Export) for each month is expressed in million US dollars. For analysis the data is broken down into HS code wise and Country wise data and visualization is shown on the dashboard. The trade deficit needs to be reduced. Bilateral ties between countries helps to reduce export duty which will help the local company compete in global market.
 

10.	FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

	The application focuses in the future will be to do an in-depth study for Indian Trade Data Analysis by doing forecasting worldwide by using different Machine Learning algorithms.
	Furthermore the results will be predicted in a more efficient way by using various forecasting models.
	Getting more points for better forecasting.
